# Development decisions 

 | Decision | Explaination |
 |----------|--------------|
 | The app is a single page application and all its page are loaded under the same resource identifier | This app contains only 2 or 3 pages (Login/register and the messaging page) and the client would not need to see more than one page at a time (depending on their authentication status) So, in order to enhance app performance and reduce page reloading, there's no point in splitting the website into multiple URIs |
 | The backend is an independent separate RESTful API project | That makes it much easier to manage the development of the app and it makes it more extensible such that for example a mobile application might be developed in the future it can share the same backend |
 | In many cases, the API responds with no content, just a status code such as 204, 401, or 404 | That's because I these cases there are no data to be sent in return. The status code is enough to describe the response so it's better to save the bandwidth for better use, and also the status code is a more standardized way to describe the intended resource. |
 | The same data is stored in multiple different fields in the database but in different formates | For example the messages collection contains a "sender" and "receiver" fields in addition to a "conversationId" field, where the conversationId field is equal to `[sender, receiver].sort().join('-')`, and the sender username in addition to their ids are saved in every message. That's because the storage is no longer as expensive as the processing power and working set memory, in addition to the fact that the object ids are very limited in size, and since mongo db is unstructured, aggregation querys would require the database engine to loops through the whole collection of both tables, possibly multiple times in order to get complete information for abstract information. That's why it's much better performance-wise to save the fields in the formates needed for each query even if that means saving the same data in multiple fields in multiple different formates |
 | Only one API endpoint ( `GET /notification`) is responsible to update the client-side with anything new | This is the best way performance-wise sine an API has to be called by the client periodically in order to keep them online and up to date with any new messages or events. Splitting it into multiple endpoints would needlessly consume more bandwidth |
